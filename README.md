#### Remember for python follow normal Hierarchy operation: 
##### first parentesis, exponentiation, multiplication and division, addition and substraction
##### Due to some historical quirk, an exception to the left-to-right left-associative rule is the exponentiation operator **. A useful hint is to always use parentheses to force exactly the order you want when exponentiation is involved

##### Open the file using with and open.

##### Use .readlines() to get a list of the lines of text in the file.

##### Use a for loop to iterate through the strings in the list, each being one line from the file. On each iteration, process that line of text

##### When you are done extracting data from the file, continue writing your code outside of the indentation. Using with will automatically close the file once the program exits the with block.

##### option for efficiency reasons.
##### with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:
#####  for lin in fileref:
